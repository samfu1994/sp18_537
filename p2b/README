Overview:
    This is a modified xv6 implementation with weird scheduling policy.

Compile:
    "make" under xv6 folder.

Design and Structure:
    According to https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/scheduling-xv6-lottery.
    The higher number tickers a process owns, the higher probability it will be scheduled. As a result, the number of times and the execution time is proportional to the number of tickets a process holds in its lifetime.


Notes:
    graph.pdf shows the result of processes who has the tickets ratio of 3:2:1.
